##Morse code information 
**Morse code** is a system of communication that uses a series of dots (.) and dashes (–) to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation. It was developed in the 1830s and 1840s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail for use with the telegraph.

Each character is transmitted by a unique sequence of short and long signals:

A **dot** is a short signal.
* A **dash** is a longer signal.

For example:

A = · –
B = – · · ·
SOS = · · · – – – · · ·

Morse code was widely used in maritime and military communications and is still used today in aviation, amateur radio, and emergency signaling due to its simplicity and effectiveness over long distances.
